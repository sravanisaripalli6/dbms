The given data is already in normalized form as:
1. There is no multi-valued attributes so it is in first normal form.
2. It does not contain any partial dependencies so it is in second normal form.
3. There is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes so it is in third normal form.
4. It is in BCNF as non-trivial non-functional dependency is a super key.
So we create an ERD diagram for the given data as follows:


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgur.com/h0oRulk.png")
```

```{r}
df<- read_xml('Books-v3.xml')
books<-xml_find_all(df, xpath = "//catalog/book")
book_id <- xml_attr(books, "id")
```

```{r}
library(lubridate)
# Load the package required to read XML files.
library(XML)
# Also load the other required package.
library("methods")
# LOADING TRANSFORMED XML INTO R DATA FRAME
doc<-xmlParse("Books-v3.xml")
xmldf <- xmlToDataFrame(nodes = getNodeSet(doc, "//book"))
xmldf$book_id<-book_id 
xmldf$price<-as.numeric(xmldf$price)
```


```{r}
xmldf<-select(xmldf,book_id, author, title, genre,price,publish_date,description)
```


```{r}
library(RSQLite)

fpath = "/Users/sravanisaripalli/Downloads/databases/"
db_file = "xml.sqlite"
# if database file already exists, we connect to it, otherwise
# we create a new database
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(fpath,db_file))
```

```{sql connection=db}
create table if not exists Book(
id text primary key,author text,title 
text,genre text,price double,
publish_date date,description text)
```

```{r}
dbWriteTable(db, "Book", xmldf, overwrite = T)
```

```{sql connection=db}
select * from Book limit 3;
```

# What is the number of genres have at least three books?

```{sql connection=db}
select count(*) as number_of_genres from(select * from Book group by genre having count(*)>=3)
```
# What is the oldest year in which a publication was published?

```{sql connection=db}
select substr(publish_date,1,4) as oldest_year from Book order by publish_date asc limit 1;
```

# Find the number of books and average price for each genre.

```{sql connection=db}
select genre,count(book_id) as number_of_books,
avg(price) as average_price from Book group by genre;
```

# List the title and author of all books that are less than 0.8*AVG or more than 1.2*AVG, where AVG is the average price of all books.

```{sql connection=db}
select title,author from Book where price<
(select avg(price)*0.8 from Book) or price>(select avg(price)*1.2  from Book); 
```

```{sql connection=db}
drop table Book;
```
